# CoffeeShop Management GUI Application

This Java GUI application is a CoffeeShop management system. It allows users to select various coffee and pastry items, calculate the total price with tax, and generate a receipt.

## Project Overview

The project uses Java AWT and Swing libraries for the graphical user interface. It consists of the following components:

- `cafeguii.gui.Dashboard`: The main GUI class that displays the coffee shop interface.
- `cafeguii.app.CoffeeShopCalculator`: A class responsible for calculating the tax based on the subtotal.
- `cafeguii.menu.CoffeeShopItem`: A class representing coffee and pastry items with name, price, icon, and label.
- `cafeguii.images2/`: Directory containing images of coffee shop items used in the GUI.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the `dist` directory.
2. Run the CoffeeShop GUI application by executing the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    java -jar CafeGuii.jar
    ```

3. Select items by checking the checkboxes and adjusting the quantity.
4. Click the "Total" button to calculate the total price with tax.
5. Optionally, print a receipt using the "Receipt" button.
